Reproducible analysis for the Dalechampia selection paper


## Table 1: Genetic and Phenotypic matrices of variance-covariance for two traits, log Gland Area (GA) and log Upper Bract Area (UBA) for two populations, Tovar and Tulum. 
**Status: not reproducible.** The data comes from a Diallel experiment reported elsewhere (Bolstad et al. 2014). The original table reports the G matrix estimated by MCMCglmm from the diallel, and the P matrix estimated from the empirical phenotypic variance-covariance of the raw data. Reproducibility would thus require the original diallel data and the original diallel analysis scripts. The current status is a G matrix calculated from the output of the MCMC chains, and a P matrix estimated from the output of the same MCMC chains. MCMC chains are stored in data/POP_logUBA_logGA_times100_x.RData , POP being either Tovar or Tulum, and x being 1 or 2 (two parallel chains for each model).  
**Note** that there was an error in the original Table 1 : phenotypic correlations were not calculated correctly (the source of the error was not identified). The Table cannot be published as intended. 

## Table 2: Model selection. 
The Selection Response Analysis procedure (sra) was applied on the selection response data for both populations, Tovar and Tulum independently. Only summary statistics (means, variances, and covariances for Up and Down selected lines at each generation) were considered for the selection response. Model selection was based on comparic the AICc score of four models: Identical genetic variances in Up and Down lines (symmetric models) and Independent genetic variances in Up and Down lines (asymmetric models), each case with and without considering the Bulmer effect (depletion of genetic variances due to the linkage disequilibrium generated by the truncation selection procedure). Model selection was applied independently on the raw phenotypic data and on the same data centered on the control line. AICc scores must not be compared between models fit on different datasets, so the procedure is not informative to assess whether centering the data on the control line improves the fit.  
**Status: reproducible** The routine calls the summarypop procedure that produces summary statistics (as in Appendices S1 and S2) from the raw datasets.  
**Note** that the output of Table 2 is totally different from earlier versions of the manuscript. The model scripts have beeen considerably simplified since these early versions, and it is not completely clear why there are no many discrepancies.  
**TODO**: check if the model implementation matches the model description from Appendix S7

## Table 3: Regression and correlations between GA and UBA. 
The table presents, for each generation, in all three lines (Up, Down, Control) and for both populations, (1) the slope of the regression between log(UBA) (response variable) and log(GA) (predictor variable), and (2) the correlation coefficient between mean individual UBA and mean GA (not log). In practice, the regression (1) is a mixed-effect model including the individual level as a random effect (up to three replicates measurements within each individual). The standard error of the regression slope is provided along with the slope, and the approximate 95% Confidence Interval (based on Fisher's Z transform method) is indicated.  
**Status: reproducible.**  
**Note:** Why is the slope calculated on log traits and the correlation on the original scale? This is the only place in the full manuscript where traits are not logged. Is it a mistake, or is there a reason for this? 

## Figures 2 and 3

## Table S1 and Table S2
Summary statistics of the results of the selection experiment (table S1 for Tovar, table S2 for Tulum). Summary statistics include: Replicate (Up, Down, Control), Generation (from 1 to 5), average log GA (trait x = selected trait), phenotypic variance in log GA, selection differential for GA, average log UBA (trait y = correlated trait), phenotypic variance in log UBA, phenotypic covariance log GA - log UBA, sample size N, standard errors for the mean trait x and y.  
**Status: reproducible.**  
**Note:** there are minor discrepancies with the previous version.  
The effect of selection on variance (difference between the variance among breeders and the variance in the population) is not provided here, although it is necessary for fitting sra models with Bulmer effect.
